# Project history:
Initially there was an idea, a written presentation of
  * inner world
  * games + literature (books, comics and others) that inspired
  * Creating my own story
The plot was used for drawings on a graphics program (Corel Draw (2003), trial versions), fictional characters were drawn

The plot is a fictional future in chronological order
5 main parts:
 1) 2024 - 2114 - S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Zone (Anomalous Barrier) and mutants
 2) 2115 - 2499 - “The Rise of the Planet of Wolves and Dogs” or the development of super-canids
 3) 2499 - 2525 - Rescue of Mira Bystrova
 4) 2526 - 2527 - World War 4 and new world order
 5) 2528 - Chronicles of Jesus Christ and Celeste.
    
The number of characters will increase as the plot develops.
In 2012 - 4.
In 2024 - 34.
The main characters have the personal features of real prototypes

the project may appear (but it is not yet clear when) as
 * a book
 * 2D game - strategy
